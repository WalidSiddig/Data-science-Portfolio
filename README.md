# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!  
This repository contains a collection of end-to-end data science projects, each showcasing skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning.  

Each project folder includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook or scripts with the full analysis  
- A `README.md` file describing the project (if applicable)  
- A `requirements.txt` file with dependencies
